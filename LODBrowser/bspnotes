found that i should use ajax to send the servlet response to another place than a blank tab
where to insert the ajax?
the d3.json only accepts something that has a different location than the html itself
d3.json(<location>,<a function>)
thinking of using jquery to reroute the call from the form on button click
and then use the post inside the d3.json()
reformatted the code in a way that the draw function is a separate function
the reformatting doesn't work.. gotta find a solution to that later, but is not necessary
plan now is to save the form data in sessionstorage and on reload of the page recall them from there
then the variables are inserted in the servlet call
the button should now only reload the page
thats all bullshit too, the right way to do it, or the easiest way is trough jquery
it finally works, kudos to Gilles
two problems now, first the graph is sometimes generated in the upper corner
second, upon searching a new entity, it just displays the second graph on top of the previous
I am also thinking of a way how to display the meaning of the connection, maybe even as node.
Also the text of the nodes is too small, the nodes are too small too
The problem of the gravity persists too
i should also make he program search for keywords which are not 100% like in the db
Succesfully set the with of the svg (where everything is drawn on) through jquery
i thought it would be nice if the text would only pop up on pointing with the mouse on it

changed the code to make it load additional nodes to fill the graph, also slight design changes
A bug persists where the graph is stuck in the corner of the svg, only pulling it makes it unfold

error at (')
look for a possibility to make pred visible after hovering 2 secs over it, look at d3 lib
leftcorner bug
reload svg before creation of new
	works 5 min
new form fields depth, limit
	configurable limit added 10 min
remove <_>
	removed symbols, now db needs much longer for response? 40 min
make work for incomplete words
	works now 10 min
different colors for different predicates

make sql query faster by grouping search string together into one single query per depth
and maybe remove terms already searched for
